# Robotic-Arm-Simulation
This software is designed to simulate the motion of a multi-degree of freedom kinematic chain with an arbitrary number of segments that form the structure of a robotic system, utilizing the principles of forward kinematics. The simulation determines the position of the starting and ending point of each segment, including the end effector of the kinematic chain (robotic system).
